# SimpleSystem

I didn't like any of the generators or build systems that I could find around, so I made my own.
Its mostly here for my personal use but if you want to use it, you are more than welcome. It's fairly easy to customise, just change the paths in the gulpfile to match your directory structure.

Includes babel, sass/scss, and browserSync with Gulp.
