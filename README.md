# SimpleSystem
A basic set of front end build tools brought together.

I didn't like any of the generators or build systems that I could find around, so I made my own.
Its mostly here for my personal use but if you want to use it, you are more than welcome.

## Getting Started

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
